This is a simple implementation of a graph. Directed and undirected graphs are 
supported, just specify with a boolean in the graph constructor. 
This mini-project was to experiment with graph traversal algorithms because 
I couldn't find a simple implementation with which to mess around with. 
Feel free to have fun with it.
